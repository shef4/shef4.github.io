                Sk is a creative collective I started in New York. It is run by myself and a team of amazing creators from South Africa (Amy Aurther, Tristan Stellenburg, Wazana Moncho, Sanikwa and Kutloano). Our mission is to create a community that celebrates self-expression and creativity, through the distribution and creation of content.

                Sk was started in April 2019, our first goal was to connect and scout like-minded creators to collaborate and work with. 
                We originally started with 30 creators from all around the world. We then planned and organized a release campaign that 
                air in November 2019. Since then Sk has successfully managed multiple projects and is steadily growing in reach.

                We aim to provide our followers with artistic and inspirational content while also creating a platform for creators to gain exposure and connect with other creators from countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,  South Africa, and Spain. Our target market is a youth with an interest in art fashion and music. The advantage Sk has is that as new content is released on the platform it leads to greater exposure and potential followers. This will lead to more creators gaining interest in the page allowing for more unique content and collaborations
                <br><br><br>
                We plan to expand our platform to more social media applications such as YouTube and Spotify as well as develop a brand website for articles, media content like playlist, videos, and e-commerce.

                                After quarantine began Sk decide to create a promotion video on IGTV for the #stayHome movement. This promotion video would contain creators from South Africa and the United States sharing their hobbies and activities while at home as a suggestion for how people can stay active indoors.

                                For this project, I was in charge of editing a shortened version of the video that was under 1 minute that could be shared as a post through Instagram

                                The video I edited reached 283 profiles and was shared by 17 accounts. The main video was able to gain 345 views.

                                As an effort to further promote the self-expression and fashion of the Sk platform, I pushed forward an IGTV project series called “My Closet”. The series is about people sharing stories about the clothes in their closest. The goal is to get the viewer to know more about the subject on a personal level through the style and clothes in their closet.

                                As Director and Project manager for this project, I organized the location for shooting, scouted cast members and a film crew, and edited the videos.
