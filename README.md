# NETWORK-4
Hi!

This project is a personal website I developed call Channel4.  I developed this website using mobile first desgin practises and tools such as Figma and Trello. The websiteemade using HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. 

I created this website as a summer pasision project during the mids of quarentine. To see what I code create if I could design and develop a website. I choose a person website because I thought it would be a good chance to exp[ress my self and my interest and I could add more to it over the years.
